/**
 * Assembles a [TextToolResult] after a node/shell action fails and a screen capture
 * is attempted.
 *
 * If the capture succeeds, the result includes the fresh tree as payload and a
 * retry hint that varies by error code:
 * - [ScreenOperationError.SHELL_TIMEOUT], [ScreenOperationError.SHELL_SESSION_LOST]:
 *   the action may have partially executed; the hint warns the LLM to inspect the
 *   tree and NOT blindly retry.
 * - All other codes: the action was definitely not executed; the hint tells the LLM
 *   to inspect the included tree and retry.
 *
 * If the capture also fails, [failureWithCaptureError] combines both error messages.
